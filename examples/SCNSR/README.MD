Training code for "Deep Networks for Image Super-Resolution with Sparse Prior" (ICCV 2015)
by Zehao Huang (email: huangzehao@buaa.edu.cn)



***********************************************************************************************************



Usage:


1. Place the "SCNSR" folder into "($Caffe_Dir)/examples/"



2. Open MATLAB and direct to ($Caffe_Dir)/example/SRCNN, run 
"generate_train.m" and "generate_test.m" to generate training and test data.
(code from "Learning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolution" by Chao Dong)


3. To train our SCNSR, run
./build/tools/caffe train --solver examples/SCNSR/SCNSR_solver.prototxt --weights examples/SCNSR/SCNSR_INI.caffemodel


4. The training result generated by our code is better than the original paper and add batch normalization is helpful both in performance and training speed in our test.


5. Shlu layer (modify from sigmoid layer) is a activation layer in the original paper, and CLN layer (modify from LRN layer) is used to compute the norm of input.
